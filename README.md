# PythonMechEng

We, Mechanical Engineering students at UW, created PythonMechEng repository to
- help (ME) students use python for their scientific needs
- provide an environment to save, explain, and share our (reproducible) work
- bring together the materials needed for a PythonMechEng workshop

Folders:
- [introduction](https://github.com/amirhamini/PythonMechEng/tree/master/introduction): start using python
- [pde-solving](https://github.com/amirhamini/PythonMechEng/tree/master/pde-solving): start solving partial differential equations in python
