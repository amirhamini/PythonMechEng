# PythonMechEng

We, Mechanical Engineering students at UW, created PythonMechEng repository to
- help (ME) students use python for their scientific needs
- provide an environment to save, explain, and, share our (reproducible) work
- bring together the materials needed for a PythonMechEng workshop
